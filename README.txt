## Author Ð Rafael Fraga
## Thanks and Acknowledgments Ð I must thank Jake Gillard at Marks Sattin for the opportunity.

## Files included Ð index.html, css folder with mail.css file, js folder with script.js file and jquery-3.1.1.js libraries, and a README.txt.

## Getting Started  - This is a single webpage App. to help reception desks organising queuing people. I can be run on desktops or mobile devices as it has been designed fully responsive.

## Remember you might see small pixel differences in different browsers as due to its plain design nor either reset.css or modernizer.css are needed.

## Operating instructions Ð bootstrap and jquery libraries are linked to its correspondent file and folder. Removing those files might weaken the App performance.

## Operating instructions Ð In a real world scenario a Council association will have the need to organise the people on arrival at a certain time.
The receptionist has the option to select the type of service the new arrived person needs. Receptionist can categorized the customers with the help of a group of buttons. This is one of the most powerful tolls of the App. as depending on which button is clicked different inputs will show up for data collection.

## Built With - Queue App has been built on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript to make it as light and dynamic as the real life in a reception desk. The Bootstrap 4.0.0 framework has been used to make the elements mobile friendly. The Grid technique has been also implemented to adapt it to different screen sizes. The JQuery framework 3.1.1.slim.min.js has been used to select the group of buttons easily. The action in the <form> has been named for future used of the file page.php.
